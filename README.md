# Retail-Store-Sales-Dashboard
# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of retail store sales performance. The dashboard tracks key metrics such as total sales amount, number of customers, and quantity sold, while also offering insights into sales distribution across locations (in-store vs. online) and payment methods. By enabling dynamic category-based filtering and visualizing sales trends over time (2022–2025), the dashboard helps identify customer preferences, seasonal patterns, and growth opportunities. Ultimately, this project aims to support data-driven decision-making, improve business strategies, and enhance overall retail performance.
